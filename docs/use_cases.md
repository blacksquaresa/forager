# Use Cases

This document will list all the relevant use cases for the Forager app. These use cases will define the requirements, and directly influence all design decisions. The final product should be held up against these use cases to assess success.

## Carol prepares to go shopping

Carol needs to go shopping, so she pulls out the app to check that her family has a running shopping list, and see what is on it. She checks through it, and sees that there are a few items missing from the list so she adds them. All the items she's missing have been added to the family item list already, so she just selects and adds them.

Carol knows that the Pick 'n Pay she is going to has intermittent connectivity, so she clicks the "Make sure my list is available offline" button. She knows that if anyone changes the list after this, she may not see the last-minute change, but at least she will not have to worry about losing the list from slow internet.

## Carol goes shopping

As she enters the Pick 'n Pay, Carol opens up the app, and chooses the Pick 'n Pay list from the current shopping list. This list includes all the items that might be available in a PNP.

The list tell her exactly what she needs to buy - not just "sugar", but "3kg Huletts brown sugar". The display lets Carol know how important it is that the exact item must be bought. In this case, it is marked as "variable", so when she can't find 3Kg of Huletts, she chooses another brand instead. She ticks off the sugar in the app.

## Carol goes to the second shop

After PNP, Carol goes to Food Lovers Market (FLM). She opens the FLM list from the current shopping list. It includes all the remaining items that could be found in FLM, but does not include sugar, which Carol has already purchased at PNP.

## Carol finishes shopping

When she's done, Carol closes the shopping list, even though there are a couple of items still un-bought. She isn't planning to get those; she's decides she can live without those for this week.

The app asks her if she'd like to carry the remaining items to the next list. She agrees, and the app automatically starts a new shopping list for next week with those items on it.

## Edgar need sugar

Edgar uses the last of the sugar in his tea, so he opens the app to add sugar to the list. His family is new to the app, and they don't have sugar in their list of regular items already, so Edgar has to add it. Edgar doesn't know the details of the sugar he needs, so he creates a new entry with just the information he knows. Edgar chooses the option to automatically add the new item to the current shopping list.

## Brad checks the list

Brad is about to go shopping, and checks the list. He sees that Edgar has added "sugar" with no details, so he updates that entry, adding a brand "Hulletts", and size "3 kg", and a description "brown sugar only". He then marks the entry with a flag that indicates that the brand and size are not deal breakers (ie: a different brand and /or size are ok as substitutes). He also adds PnP and FLM as sources for the sugar. The entry is now updated permanently, not just for this shopping list.

## Brad gets the app for the first time

Brad finds this new great app on the app store, and decides to try it for his family. He launches the app, and creates a new Family (Dershowitz). He adds four or five of the most common items his family buys every week to the family database, but leaves the rest for later. He also adds Carol and Edgar as family members using their gmail email accounts.

## Carol gets the app too

Brad shows Carol the app. She downloads it, and logs in. She sees that she is automatically part of the Dershowitz family, and can see the (still very short) list of items in the family database.

## Carol adds a menu

Carol decides to add a menu for Mac and Cheese. She adds the macaroni, cheese and milk, and defines what quantities are required for the menu. For each item, she is asked for the full details of brand, size, description and list of sources.

She adds this menu to the current shopping list, and sees the three items she created added to the list. Each item has a special mark which, when clicked, tells Carol that this iem has been added for the Mac and Cheese menu; this information might be useful when deciding on quantities or substitutes in the store.
